This is basically for departmental clearance, how to go about it

   Having purchased your clearance form;

1. Meet Course Advisor first of to ensure that your name is among in the first list whereby he'll give you a short note to satisfy that you're ready for further clearance 

2. You then proceed to Project Coordinator's office (Engr. Jerry) to clear that your group submitted the required 4 copies of your project and sort of and you'll be given short note there too

3. you move down to Laboratory to meet Nigeria Brewery or Engr. Olisakwe

4. You head back to the department with all your departmental due receipts and meet the fair lady inside that corner
[06/06/2023, 11:04:58] Wizzy: So point to note- 
1. Bio data is for people that have been cleared to serve. *Though everyone can submit, it doesn’t count for anything until you are cleared and you are ready to serve.*
2. If you want to do dept clearance you have to get your original dept due receipt from year 1-5. 

3. You must do dept clearance first before doing any other clearance. Apart from MEDICALS .. 
4. Better hold small change for pocket as you deh enter any office. 
5. Since you have done you dept clearance, no be by force to give anyone anything. If them insist, go report the person 😅😅🤣🤣

Good luck guys.
